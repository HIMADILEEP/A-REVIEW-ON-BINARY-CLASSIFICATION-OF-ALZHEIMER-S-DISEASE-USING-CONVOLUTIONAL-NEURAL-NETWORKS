# A-REVIEW-ON-BINARY-CLASSIFICATION-OF-ALZHEIMER-S-DISEASE-USING-CONVOLUTIONAL-NEURAL-NETWORKS
Alzheimer’s disease(AD),the world’s most common form of dementia, is one of the worst thing that can ever  happen to a person during his lifetime. With a poorly understood cause and no curative treatment, the disease is  actually a burden for the patients. Early detection of Alzheimer’s and its prodromal stage is very important for  possible delay in provision of the disease, and there is thus a great deal of interest in the development of new  methods for earlier detection. Structural irregularities in the brain is one of the sensitive feature of the disease  (observable on MR images).Deep Neural Network architectures such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)  has gained a great attention due to its ability to carry out highly discriminative feature representation for  classification from images. In this paper, a detailed description about CNN based classification approaches that  are designed to accurately classify AD patients from normal ones is presented.
